00:28.310 --> 00:30.129
Is this your first time seeing him?

00:30.130 --> 00:31.726
He sure is huge.

00:31.727 --> 00:34.952
He's not even breaking a sweat
with four sacks of rice on his back.

00:34.953 --> 00:37.623
But is it true that he killed someone?

00:37.960 --> 00:39.862
He kind of gives me the creeps.

00:43.360 --> 00:45.626
Move the grains into storage.

00:45.627 --> 00:48.193
Yuk-chil, fetch three rolls
of cotton cloth.

00:48.194 --> 00:49.160
Yes, my lord.

00:50.794 --> 00:53.354
Very good, Bong-chun.
You have done well.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.796
I heard it was
quite a bountiful harvest this year.

00:57.506 --> 01:00.551
Well, it was better
than last year, my lord.

01:00.552 --> 01:02.993
Then, how about taking
a servant boy with you?

01:02.994 --> 01:06.299
I am sure you could use
an extra pair of hands.

01:06.689 --> 01:09.373
- I can give you a good deal on him.
- Pardon?

01:10.002 --> 01:11.906
He is young and clever.

01:12.113 --> 01:15.297
I had to teach him a lesson
for causing trouble,

01:15.298 --> 01:19.620
but you have nothing to worry about
since I fixed that nasty habit of his.

01:54.027 --> 01:56.144
Sun-gap, that feels so good.

01:56.697 --> 01:59.959
This reminds me of our first time.

02:01.060 --> 02:03.410
We almost got caught that time.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.846
You need to get better soon

02:06.327 --> 02:08.527
so we can do this more often.

02:09.874 --> 02:10.987
All right.

02:17.050 --> 02:18.027
That is so good.

Wait, hold on.

02:45.419 --> 02:46.591

02:48.494 --> 02:50.026

Hey, Bong-chun.

03:27.233 --> 03:29.395
I'm coming, Mother.

03:31.427 --> 03:32.993
Is someone here?

03:32.994 --> 03:35.393
Of course, not.
No one is here.

03:35.394 --> 03:39.159
Then why have you been
rummaging around since last night?

03:39.160 --> 03:42.494
You're acting all antsy
as if you are trying to hide something.

03:43.260 --> 03:45.526
Have you brought back a bride by chance?

03:45.527 --> 03:49.493
- Have you brought me a daughter-in-law?
- It's nothing like that.

03:49.494 --> 03:52.960
Goodness, you have finally found a bride.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.180
- My son has a bride.
<i>- A bride? Is she talking about me?</i>
